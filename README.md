## Background

This little thing was as simple as a project can be, maybe it does not even qualify as one. Back then, the "Pet the X" meme was rather popular. One iteration of this meme, "[Pet the Pop Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCjxT-Ukhac)" caught my eyes. The premise of the video is simple, you have a hand and a object, while the ending theme of "[Super Mario: World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waKumDkYrDY)" plays in the background. Then the hand goes in to pet the object. In response to the pet, the object jiggles, which is always endearing.

The whole point of Pet The Peepo was to do the same, but on a browser. I found a perfect loop for the background track, a still image of Pepe, and a gif of a hand petting Peepo. Putting these together was not at all difficult, essentially, there is an element in the middle of the website. When clicked or pressed, it would swap the static image of Pepe with a running the gif of a hand petting Peepo. It also triggers the background track to play. When the element is not longer pressed, it resets every thing back to the initial state. It swaps the gif back to the still image and stops the background track.

A note from ~2 years ago:

> Remember PopCat and Pet the Pepe? What if we combine them together in to webpage.
>
> Basically, the site has the PopCat. When the user left click, a hand will pet the cat. If they hold their left click, the hand will keep petting the cat. Thatâ€™s it really.
>
> The inner working is very simple.
>
> When we click the we change the state of the image from static to a gif version. Once the user let go of the mouse we simply change the state back to static image.
